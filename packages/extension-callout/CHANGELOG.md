## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 83cc996: Close the gap against the documented Notion-style feature set.

  New nodes, all in `StarterKit`: callout (tip/info/warning/important/success),
  collapsible toggle, hard break, self-hosted video/audio/file, bookmark cards,
  and inline `@` mentions with a `MentionMenu` component.

  Fixes and additions to what was already there:
  - the slash menu's Heading 1/2/3 items all inserted an H1 — the level was
    passed positionally where the command expects `{ level }`
  - slash search falls back to fuzzy matching, and remembers recent commands
  - `- [ ]` starts a to-do list and `---` a divider
  - to-do items render a real checkbox instead of a styled attribute
  - `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` walk table cells
  - `Mod-K` opens the host app's link dialog via `Link.onEditLink`
  - pasted Markdown becomes blocks and a pasted URL becomes a link
  - images take alignment, a caption, and alt text from a node-view toolbar
  - code blocks show line numbers
  - the block menu's "Turn Into" submenu no longer tears down mid-click
