## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 80bce48: Fixes from testing every ready-made editor as a user.

  - **Breaking (styles):** the stylesheet's `demo-*` classes are now `rk-*` (`.rk-frame`, `.rk-page`, `.rk-scroll`, `.rk-toolbar`, `.rk-frame.rk-notion`, …). Rename any selectors that target them.
  - `MarkdownEditor` keeps formulas: `$…$` and `$$…$$` no longer lose their dollars on the first edit. Load `@richkitjs/extension-math/style.css` to render them.
  - Markdown read into a schema without math keeps `$…$` as written instead of dropping the dollars.
  - `TrackChangesEditor`: a new `value` from the parent (a reset, a loaded record) is no longer recorded as a suggestion. Core now marks `setContent` transactions with `SET_CONTENT_META`, which edit-tracking plugins can skip.
  - The stylesheet now carries ProseMirror's required styles, so spaces are no longer typed and saved as `&nbsp;`.
  - `ref.clear()` fires `onChange` with `''`, so a controlled parent stays in sync. `setValue()` is documented as meant for uncontrolled editors.
  - `DocxEditor` in light theme sits on a grey desk instead of a black one.
  - `QuestionEditor` answer options are one paragraph: Enter no longer adds lines, and pasted paragraphs join. The docs now show how formulas are written in the value.
  - `NotionEditor`'s `footer` renders in a styled slot under the status bar.
  - Picking a mention inserts a space after it.
  - The bubble menu no longer appears for a selection with no text, and commenting on one shows the "select some text" hint instead of silently doing nothing.
  - `AgentEditor` shows its Ctrl/⌘+Enter shortcut, and its dock controls are labelled.
  - Icon-only toolbar and editor buttons have an `aria-label`, not just a tooltip.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 01a839d: Register a Pro licence key from a prop or an option, not only `setLicenseKey`.

  Every Pro editor takes a `licenseKey` prop, and every Pro package that is not a
  component takes the same key as an option: `Comment.configure({ licenseKey })`,
  the new `trackChangesKit({ licenseKey })`, `AI.configure({ licenseKey })`,
  `openaiComplete`/`anthropicComplete`, and the DOCX export and import helpers.

  The key stays global to the page, so any one of them registers it for every Pro
  package. `setLicenseKey` now ignores an empty value and re-registering the same
  key, which makes it safe to call on every render and stops an unset env var in a
  preview build from clearing a key something else already registered.

- 3ec0ab4: RichKit is now open-core.

  The core editor, the React and Vue bindings, the starter kit, HTML, Markdown and every basic
  extension stay **MIT** — free for any use.

  `docx`, `extension-track-changes`, `extension-comments`, `extension-ai`, `ai-openai`,
  `ai-anthropic` and the new `editors-pro` become **RichKit Pro**, under the RichKit Pro License Agreement.
  They run without a key on localhost and other development hosts. In production, register the
  key you receive after purchase:

  ```ts
  import { setLicenseKey } from '@richkitjs/license'

  setLicenseKey('YOUR-LICENCE-KEY')
  ```

  The new `@richkitjs/license` package verifies the key offline — no activation call, no
  telemetry. Without a valid key, Pro packages show a small "unlicensed" badge and log one
  warning; they never stop working or block editing. A key keeps working, forever, with every
  release up to its "updates until" date.

  **Breaking — `@richkitjs/starter-kit`:** `StarterKit` no longer includes `Comment` or
  `TrackChangesKit`, and no longer re-exports them. Add them yourself:

  ```ts
  import { Comment } from '@richkitjs/extension-comments'
  import { TrackChangesKit } from '@richkitjs/extension-track-changes'

  useEditor({ extensions: [...StarterKit, Comment, ...TrackChangesKit] })
  ```

  **Breaking — `@richkitjs/editors`:** `SimpleEditor`, `NotionEditor`, `ClassicEditor`, `QuestionEditor`,
  `CommentsEditor`, `TrackChangesEditor`, `DocxEditor` and `AgentEditor` moved to the new
  `@richkitjs/editors-pro`. `@richkitjs/editors` keeps the free editors (Minimal, HTML,
  Markdown, Mentions, Comment box, Find & replace), is MIT, and now exports its field helpers
  (`useEditorField`, `FieldValue`, `useTheme`, `withPlaceholder`, `cx`) for building your own.
  Both packages share `@richkitjs/editors/style.css`.

  `AgentEditor` gains a `complete` prop that takes the same streaming transport as
  `@richkitjs/extension-ai` (e.g. `anthropicComplete({ endpoint: '/api/ai' })`). Drafted sections
  stream into the document as Markdown-rendered content, land as one undo step, and can be
  stopped mid-stream.
